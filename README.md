The purpose of this assignment is to get you to do more thread programming and process
synchronization, and also reinforce our discussion of caching from class. In this assignment you
build upon Assignment 3, to create a Caching Multithreaded Scheduling Web Server. You will:
1. Implement cache in your Assignment 3 solution (or the one provided), and
2. Create a test suite for the caching multithreaded scheduling web server.
You have a choice: You can either use your code from Assignment 3 as the starting point, or you can
use the provided solution to Assignment 3. Regardless, you need to ensure that you have assn4
checked out in your SVN repository. This directory will contain the solution to Assignment 3.
Please follow the guidelines in Section 5.1.
